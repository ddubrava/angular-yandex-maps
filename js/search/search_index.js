If you raise\na duplicate issue, you're just creating noise for everyone watching this repo.\nBefore raising a bug, ensure you are using the latest version of our packages. We release every week, so there's a good\nchance your issue might have already been fixed.\nFinally, when raising a new issue, please fill out the issue template - please don't skip sections.\nPlease provide as much information as possible. This project is maintained by volunteers, so the more information\nyou provide, the less likely we will have to waste everyone's time in asking you for more information.\nIf you have a particularly complex issue - consider creating a small, self-contained reproduction repo. This will help\nyou in figuring out the exact problem, and will help us in reproducing and diagnosing the bug.\nHelp us to help you\nCommenting\nFeel free to comment on any open issue if you have more information that you feel like you can provide. If you don't\nhave more information, instead use the \"reaction\" feature on the root comment for the issue. We use reactions to help\ngauge which issues are important to the community, so these are the best way to show us an issue is important.\nPlease refrain from leaving useless comments on issues. Comments like \"+1\", or \"when's this getting fixed\", or \"any\nprogress on this\" just serve as spam, and annoy every single person subscribed to the issue. Generally we will just\ndelete those comments, so save everyone time and think twice.\nPlease refrain from commenting on old, closed issues and PRs. Your issue is rarely related enough to a closed issue to\nwarrant \"necroing\" a dead thread - raising a new issue means you can fill in the template, and make it easier for us to\nhelp you. Often times if you comment on a closed issue, we will just ask you to open a new issue, so please save\neveryone's time, and help us to help you.\nPlease refrain from commenting on master commits. Commit comments are not searchable, meaning that nobody else can\ndiscover your comments. Raise an issue and reference the commit instead so that everyone can see your comment, and you\ncan fill out the template.\n\nCommit Message Format\n[optional scope]: \n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]Where  is one of:\n\nfeat - for any new functionality additions\nfix - for any bug fixes that don't add new functionality\ntest - if you only change tests, and not shipped code\ndocs - if you only change documentation, and not shipped code\nchore - anything else\n\nAnd  may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within\nparenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.\nAnd  is a succinct title for the commit.\nBREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a\nbreaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any\ntype.\nExamples\nCommit message with description and breaking change footer\nfeat: allow provided config object to extend other configs\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config filesCommit message with no body\ndocs: correct spelling of CHANGELOGCommit message with scope\nfeat(lang): add polish languagePull Requests\nAnyone is free to help us build and maintain this project. If you see an issue that needs working on because it's\nimportant to you, comment on the issue to help make sure that nobody else works on it at the same time, and then start\nworking.\nDeveloping in this repo is easy:\n\nFirst fork the repo, and then clone it locally.\nCreate a new branch.\nIn the root of the project, run npm install or yarn install.\nCreate environment.local.ts in environments directory to provide an API key\nAdd export const environment = { production: false, apikey: UNDEFINED_OR_YOUR_API_KEY }\n\n\nRun npm run start:lib to start the library, then run npm start to start the app.\nMake the required changes.\n\nRaising a PR\nOnce your changes are ready, you can raise a PR. The title of your PR should match the Commit Message format.\nMake sure you use the \"Fixes #xxx\" format to reference issues, so that GitHub automatically closes the issues when we\nmerge the PR. Also note that if you are fixing multiple issues at once, you can only reference one issue per line, and\nmust put one \"Fixes #xxx\" per issue number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"coverage.html":{"url":"coverage.html","title":"coverage -

For example,\nthe Map class has state and options.\nexport class AppComponent {\n  state: ymaps.IMapState = {\n    center: [55.751952, 37.600739],\n    zoom: 3,\n  };\n\n  options: ymaps.IMapOptions = {\n    maxZoom: 5,\n  };\n}It can also have individual options set for some of the most common options.\nNot every option has its own input. See the API for each component to see if the option has a dedicated input or if it\nshould be set in the options input.\nComponents events\nThe Yandex.Maps components implement all the events for their respective classes from the Yandex.Maps JavaScript API\nthrough outputs. For example, to add the listener on the balloonclose event\nfrom Map class.\nHow can I access to the created object instance and global API object?\nThe Yandex.Maps components implement ready output\nreturning YaReadyEvent interface.\nexport class AppComponent {\n  onMapReady(event: YaReadyEvent): void {\n    const { ymaps, target } = event;\n  }\n}How can I create a component that doesn't exist in the library?\nYou should use the global API object, there are two ways to get it:\n\nUse components outputs (recommended)\nUse YaApiLoaderService\n\nProperty XXX does not exist on type typeof ymaps.\nOur Yandex.Maps typings are not ideal, there are a lot of missing fields. Unfortunately, at the same time a lot of\nfields are not documented in the Yandex.Maps API. If you find any problems, submit a bug please and use type casting.\nconst instance = new (ymaps as any).UnexistingClass();Is it possible to load the API without using components?\nUse YaApiLoaderService.\nimport { YaApiLoaderService } from 'angular8-yandex-maps';\n\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(private yaApiLoaderService: YaApiLoaderService) {\n    this.yaApiLoaderService.load().subscribe((v) => console.log(v));\n  }\n}How can I use the geocoder?\nUse YaGeocoderService.\nimport { YaGeocoderService } from 'angular8-yandex-maps';\n\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(private yaGeocoderService: YaGeocoderService) {\n    this.yaGeocoderService.geocode('Moscow').subscribe((v) => console.log(v));\n  }\n}\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
