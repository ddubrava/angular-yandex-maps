##### GeoObjects

Please note that Polyline, Polygon, Rectangle etc. are GeoObjects. The library doesn't export separate components for
them. It exports a GeoObject component, using it you can create any of them. For instance, a polyline is a geo object
with the geometry `geometry.LineString`. A polygon is a geo object with the geometry `geometry.Polygon`. For further
information, please see Yandex.Maps API documentation.
