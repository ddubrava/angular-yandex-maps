# Examples

The only thing this library does is wrap the Yandex.Maps JavaScript API classes.
This means that in most cases, all the arguments you see in a class can be passed to a component.
So, components are just wrappers without any additional logic.

That's why you can use any example from the [official documentation](https://yandex.ru/dev/jsapi30/doc/en/examples/).

Migrating these examples to Angular is in progress...
