### Examples

The only thing this library does is wrap the Yandex.Maps JavaScript API classes.
This means that, in most cases, all the arguments you see in a class can be passed to a component.
So, components are simply wrappers without any additional logic.

The Angular library is developed to be as close as possible to the official React library.
That's why I recommend checking [the official React examples](https://yandex.com/dev/jsapi30/doc/en/examples/).
Most of them can be easily rewritten for Angular.
